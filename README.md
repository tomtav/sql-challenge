## Background

Its been two weeks since I've been hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard. My first major task is a research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remain of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files.

My responsibilites for this project were to perform the following tasks:

1. Data Modeling
